<h2 class="two"  style="color:red">Computer Programming</h2>
<img src="../img/uzpvgtxoo6gxgzf2bskt.gif " style="width:60%;">
<p style="color:white;">Programming has helped me strengthen and develop several characteristics which I believe are important to any successful person. The computer programming problems and challenges, constant learning, and satisfaction that come from programming make me love my job.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="two" style="color:red">Hacking</h2>
<img src="../img/PD4.gif" style="width:60%;">
<h4 style="color:white"> Learning how to hack will help me to implement the strongest possible security practices. It is as much about finding and fixing security vulnerabilities as it is about anticipating them. Learning about the methods hackers use to infiltrate systems will help me to resolve issues before they become dangerous.</h4><br>
<h2 class="two" style="color:red">Mountain Climbing</h2>
<img src="../img/mountain.gif" style="width:60%;">

<p style="color:white;">Imagine feeling unstoppable. Having the skills, drive and resilience to overcome obstacles and achieve anything you want to. Imagine knowing what it would take to perform to your maximum day in, day out, and believing you could do it. Imagine being able to assess and accept the risks of failure and progress as though you had no doubt you would succeed. Climbing gives me this.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="two" style="color:red">Swimming</h2>
<img src="../img/giphy.gif" style="width:60%;">
<p style="color:white;">As well as being fun, swimming is a great way to keep fit and well and make friends.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="two" style="color:red">Singing</h2>
<img src="../img/ThunderousGiddyElk-size_restricted.gif" style="width:60%;">
<h4 style="color:white">Singing is the only form of music where there are words to give specific meaning, augmented by the melodies, tones, and rhythms used by other instruments. </h4><br>
